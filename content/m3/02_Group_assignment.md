# Portfolio Exercise 2: Transformer Models
> **Note:** M3 - Group Assignment 2 Deadline: Tuesday 26th of November

## Introduction

This exercise is designed to deepen your understanding and skills in modern deep learning techniques. You should focus on using SBERT for semantic search and create a Streamlit app for your semantic search. In addition, you need to use Hugging Face functions to summarize or classify the results of the query research in the Streamlit app.

## SBERT and Semantic Search

### Task Description

Create something innovative using SBERT and semantic search, or even more! The guidelines are intentionally broad to encourage creativity. Here are some ideas to get you started:

- Implement a semantic search engine (Text, Image or YouTube search function using CLIP).
- Use the Hugging Face pipeline to summarize or classify the query research results.
- (Optional) Use SetFit for supervised tasks with SBERT models.
- Consider building a search engine using a Gradio or Streamlit app.



<!-- ## Part 2: Gradient Descent and Attention Mechanism Exercises

### Task Description

1. **Gradient Descent Exercise**: Execute the process of updating weights for two examples using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). Document each step, including input calculation, prediction, loss assessment, weight adjustments, and updates.

2. **Attention Mechanism Exercise**: Implement the attention mechanism on two distinct sentences. Choose sentences with polysmous words to demonstrate its functionality effectively.

## Data

- You may utilize datasets from ðŸ¤— Hugging Face, Kaggle, or create your own.
- For inspiration, refer to the [GIF search engine](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/gif-search/) and [YouTube search](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/youtube-search/) projects.

## Delivery

- Create a dedicated GitHub repository for this assignment.
- Store all relevant materials, including the Colab notebook, in the repository.
- Provide a README.md file with a concise description of the assignment and its components.
- You may work individually or in groups of up to three members.
- Submit your work by emailing a link to the repository to Hamid (hamidb@business.aau.dk).
