## M3 - Applied Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence
> **Note:** M3 - Final Assignment Deadline: on Friday, 07-03-2025, at 12:00


This course provides a practical and applied introduction to deep learning, specifically focusing on LLMs. It covers the fundamentals of deep learning, including foundational concepts, tensors, typical architectures, and applications in different contexts. The course will also delve into various training paradigms and tools prevalent in deep learning.

Initially, the course focuses on traditional neural network architectures such as ANNs, CNNs, RNNs, and LSTMs, exploring their utility in addressing economic challenges like forecasting. As the course progresses, students will delve into advanced topics such as GNNs, Transformer models, and GPT models, focusing on the attention mechanism and its role in enhancing model performance. Practical insights will be shared on tools within the GNN, Transformer, and GPT ecosystems and their applications in real-world scenarios.

Real-world examples from economics and other fields will be used to illustrate the concepts and techniques taught throughout the course. By the end, students will have a robust understanding of deep learning and its applications in the real world, having collaborated on four mini-projects to apply these concepts to real-world research scenarios, ultimately curating a portfolio to showcase their skills.
