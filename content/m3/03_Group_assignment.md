# Portfolio Exercise 3: GPT Models
> **Note:** M3 - Group Assignment 3 Deadline: Tuesday 3rd of December at 12:00 PM

![LangChain Cheat Sheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaubs/ds-master/main/data/Images/langchain_cheatsheet.png)

<!-- ## Introduction

This assignment focuses on leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques, particularly in the context of extracting and synthesizing information from various documents (or a document). You'll be using Langchain to implement these concepts and create a system that not only generates responses but also retrieves relevant information from a database.

## Objective

### Task Description

Your task is to create a system that uses RAG for extracting information from a set of documents or a document which can be either a scientific paper or report. This involves integrating a database to store vectors of document information and designing customized prompts to effectively use GPT models for generation. Here are some project ideas:

1. Build a QA system that retrieves information from a given set of documents (or a document) to answer complex queries.
2. Develop a tool for summarizing research papers, where the system extracts key points from a database of paper vectors.
3. Create a recommendation engine that suggests content based on user queries and retrieved document data.
4. Explore other innovative applications of RAG, such as automated content generation, data analysis, or any other creative use case you can envision.

### Key Components

- **Database Integration:** Set up a database to store and retrieve vectors representing document information.
- **Customized Prompts:** Design and implement prompts that effectively utilize GPT models for generation based on retrieved data.
- **RAG Implementation:** Use Langchain to integrate retrieval-augmented generation in your system. -->
## Assignment Title:  **GPT Models and AI Agents for Economic Analysis**

## Introduction  

This assignment is designed to enhance your understanding of modern AI techniques, particularly the use of AI agents in conjunction with GPT models, and their applications in economics. You will utilize GPT models and AI agents to analyze economic data or solve an economic problem. The project involves using **FlowiseAI** to build and deploy your AI workflows, including agents, and creating an interactive **Streamlit app** to showcase your results.  

## Task Description  

Create an innovative project that employs GPT models and AI agents to address an economic question or analyze economic data. The guidelines are broad to encourage creativity. In addition to exploring the Marketplaces tab on FlowiseAI, below are some ideas to inspire your project:  

#### 1. **Automated Economic Analysis Agent**  
- Develop an AI agent that autonomously collects economic data from various sources.  
- The agent uses a GPT model to analyze the data and generate insights or summaries.  
- Implement features where the agent can answer user queries about the data in real-time.  

#### 2. **Economic Forecasting Agent**  
- Create an agent that predicts future economic indicators based on historical data.  
- The agent utilizes GPT models to interpret trends and provide forecasts.  
- Visualize predictions in your Streamlit app with interactive charts.  

#### 3. **Policy Impact Simulation Agent**  
- Build an agent that simulates the potential impact of different economic policies.  
- Users input policy parameters, and the agent uses GPT models to generate scenario analyses.  
- The agent provides recommendations or cautions based on the simulations.  

#### 4. **Market Sentiment Monitoring Agent**  
- Design an agent that continuously monitors news outlets, social media, and financial reports.  
- The agent performs sentiment analysis using GPT models to gauge market mood.  
- Present findings in the Streamlit app with sentiment scores and key highlights.  

#### 5. **Educational Economic Chatbot Agent**  
- Develop a conversational agent that educates users on economic concepts and current events.  
- The agent answers questions, explains topics, and provides examples using GPT models.  
- Enhance user engagement with interactive elements in the Streamlit app.  

## Data

- Utilize open-source datasets or create your own corpus of documents for retrieval.

## Delivery

- Create a dedicated GitHub repository for this assignment.
- Store all relevant materials, including the Colab notebook, in the repository.
- Provide a README.md file with a concise description of the assignment and its components.
- You may work individually or in groups of up to three members.
- Submit your work by emailing a link to the repository to Hamid (hamidb@business.aau.dk).

Good luck, and let your creativity shine! ðŸŽ‰
