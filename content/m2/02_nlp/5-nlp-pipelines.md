This module covers advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Large Language Model (LLM) pipelines. We'll work with two practical applications:

1. Structured information extraction
2. Audio-to-blog content creation

## Structured Information Extraction with LLMs

We'll explore how to extract structured data from unstructured text using Large Language Models.

**Topics covered:**
- OpenAI client setup with custom API keys
- Prompt engineering for information extraction
- Pydantic models for structured data
- Schema enforcement approaches
- Few-shot learning implementation

## Audio-to-Blog Pipeline with Local LLMs

Learn to build an end-to-end pipeline that converts audio content into blog posts using local Large Language Models.

**Topics covered:**
- Podcast transcription with Whisper
- Ollama setup for local LLM inference
- Transcript analysis and key topic extraction
- Blog post generation from structured info
- Together API for advanced model usage
- Image generation for blog illustrations
