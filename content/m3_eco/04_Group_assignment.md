## Introduction

This assignment encourages you to build an engaging and, if possible, fun application using the techniques learned in this module. The focus is on applying advanced AI and DL methods to solve relevant tasks, with an emphasis on creativity and practical application.

## Objective

### Task Description

Your goal is to develop an application that uses advanced AI techniques and DL for a specific, relevant task. The application should be more than a simple semantic search tool and should exhibit innovation in its approach and functionality. 

### Key Components

- **Transformer Utilization:** Implement self-trained or fine-tuned transformers. However not sentence transformer for semantic search only (you are welcome to explore techniques beyond the scope of the course e.g. on HF)
  
- **Platform Integration:** The model should be published on Hugging Face (HF) and include a Gradio app (in-notebook) or HF spaces.

## Additional Features (Nice-to-Have)

- A Streamlit app hosted on HF Hub.
- Optional use of various APIs (e.g., HF Inference API, Cohere), but be mindful of costs, especially with OpenAI.
- Explore techniques beyond the course scope, such as those available on Hugging Face or other platforms.A more complex LLM setup integrating tools like langchain, promptify, pinecone, etc.

## Data

- You may use open-source datasets or create your own data for the application.
- Ensure that your data choice effectively demonstrates the capabilities of your application.

## Submission

- Create a GitHub repository specifically for this assignment.
- Include all necessary materials, such as code, datasets, and a descriptive README.md.
- Submissions can be individual or in groups of up to three members.
- Submission also via DigitalExam, where you compile all your previous assignments and submit in one file for the overall portfolio for the module exam. You are welcome to tweak/improve previous module submissions for that.
