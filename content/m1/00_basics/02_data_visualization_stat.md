The Exploratory Data Analysis and Essential Statistics introduces students how to use EDA and some fundamental concepts of statistical methods to uncover patterns, anomalies, and frame questions in data. Students will learn foundational measures and techniques for data interpretation, and they will have the opportunity to apply EDA and statistical methods on datasets through hands-on exercises.

**‼️ Group Portfolio Assignment - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) ‼️**  
Deadline: Friday, 8 September 2023, 12:00 PM

## Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis & Essential Statistics
* Deep Dive into EDA: Uncover patterns, anomalies, and frame questions.
* Key Statistical Concepts: Foundational measures and techniques for data interpretation.
* Hands-on Analysis: Apply EDA and statistical methods on datasets.

## Part 2: EDA-Exercise on a Real Dataset
* Dataset Exploration: Dive into a real dataset, identifying patterns and insights.
* Practical Techniques: Implement key EDA methods learned earlier.
* Guided Assistance: Benefit from on-the-spot guidance by the teacher and TAs during the exercise.

## Part 3: Data Visualization in Data Science
* Foundations of Visualization: Understand the importance of effective data visualization in Data Science and the principles that drive meaningful visuals.
* Seaborn Mastery: Explore **[Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)**, a Python library for intuitive statistical graphics.
* Altair Exploration: Delve into **[Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/)**, a declarative visualization library for Python.
* Hands-on Visualization: Harness both **[Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)** and **[Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/)** to craft impactful visualizations with real datasets.
