## How does Math help us?

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaubs/ds-master/main/data/Images/Math-ML.jpeg)

Machines can only understand numbers. For instance, to perform ML algorithms on text and multimedia, they need to be stored in vectors, matrices, and tensors. An example would be the representation of text as a vector of 768 dimensions. Using linear algebra, you can manipulate vectors, matrices, and tensors.



We will focus on understanding the mathematics behind ML algorithms in two dimensions. This tutorial will provide you with an overview of how machine learning algorithms work when applied to higher-dimensional data.
