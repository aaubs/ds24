Streamlit provides an easy and rapid way to turn data scripts into interactive web apps. However, at times, developers may need to ensure that their Streamlit applications run offline. Here's a simple guide to setting up Streamlit in an offline environment using Anaconda and Visual Studio Code (VSCode).

## Setup with Anaconda Environment

Follow these steps to set up Streamlit within an Anaconda environment:

1. **Install Anaconda & VSCode**
    - Download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).
    - Download and install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

2. **Create a Python Conda Environment**
    ```bash
    conda create --name bds-streamlit python==3.11.4
    ```

3. **Activate the Environment**
    ```bash
    conda activate bds-streamlit
    ```

4. **Install pipreqs**
    - pipreqs is a handy tool that scans through your project files, detects the Python imports, and subsequently generates a `requirements.txt` file.
    ```bash
    pip install pipreqs
    ```

5. **Generate requirements.txt**
    ```bash
    pipreqs
    ```

6. **Install the Necessary Packages**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Alternative Setup without Anaconda Environment

If you'd rather not use a specific environment:

1. **Install Anaconda & VSCode** (as mentioned above).

2. **Install the Required Packages Directly**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas streamlit matplotlib altair seaborn
    ```

## Running the Streamlit App

1. **Navigate to Your Project Directory**
    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/app_directory
    ```

2. **Run the App**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

    - Alternatively (especially for Windows users), you can execute:
    ```bash
    python -m streamlit run app.py
    ```

With these steps, you're all set to develop and run your Streamlit apps offline! Whether you're using an Anaconda environment or not, the process is straightforward and ensures you have all the necessary dependencies installed.
