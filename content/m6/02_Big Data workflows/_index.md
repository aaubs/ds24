Introduction to Big Data workflows: In ML projects, it is often necessary to process large amounts of data, known as Big Data. 

This will be demonstrated at the case of Spark, a powerful Big Data processing engine allowing to work with large datasets in ML projects. The introduction will include tasks such as setting up a Spark environment, reading and writing data, and performing transformations and aggregations on data.
