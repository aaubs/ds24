MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) is the practice of streamlining and automating the process of deploying, monitoring, and maintaining machine learning models. In this hands-on tutorial, we will walk you through the essential steps of implementing MLOps on AWS using MLflow.

This session will provide a hands-on project to reinforce your understanding and skills in working with MLflow on AWS in ML projects.
