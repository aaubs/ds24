Data: The data is to be found at: https://github.com/SDS-AAU/SDS-master/tree/master/00_data/network_krackhard (Hint: You need to download the raw data) Data: What do I get? Background Let the fun begin. You will analyze network datacollected from the managers of a high-tec company. This dataset, originating from the paper below, is widely used in research on organizational networks.</description></item><item><title>NW Cases</title><link>https://aaubs.github.io/ds24/en/m2/01_networks/4-tutorials-elites-eu-ai-companies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aaubs.github.io/ds24/en/m2/01_networks/4-tutorials-elites-eu-ai-companies/</guid><description>Case 1: Danish Power Elites Many people dream of being one of them, but only few make it all the way to the top.
